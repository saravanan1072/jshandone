    <h1>PROBLEM SOLVING</h1>
    <h3>1.PrepBuddy has an analog clock which consists of two hands one for hour and another for minute. She wants to calculate the shorter angle formed between hour and minute hand at any given time.</h3>

        N
         as input from the user and find out whether the given year is a Leap Year or not.</h3>

    <h3>3.Have you heard of Perfect numbers? If not let me tell you what is it, Perfect Numbers are integers that are equal to the sum of all its divisors except that number itself.

        Now, You are given an integer
